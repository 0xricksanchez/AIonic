# AIonic

AIonic is a Rust library designed to interface seamlessly with a range of public
Language Model APIs, offering a streamlined, user-friendly experience. The name
AIonic not only encapsulates our focus on AI, but also alludes to 'ionic bonds'
â€” representing our mission to connect various elements of AI through a single
interface. In a sense, just like ionic bonds facilitate the flow of electrons,
AIonic promotes a seamless flow of data and functionality between different language
models, all within the vibrant, performant world of Rust.
